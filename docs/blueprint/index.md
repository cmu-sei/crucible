# ![Blueprint Logo](../assets/img/blueprint-logo.png) **Blueprint:** Building a MSEL

## Overview

### What is Blueprint?

[**Blueprint**](#glossary) is a web application created to make the development of a [Master Scenario Event List (MSEL)](#glossary) and [events](#glossary) easier. With this application, it will further simplify the creation and visualization of the MSEL, allowing the user to select/define the simulated entities, attacks, timeframe, and regulators impacted by the scenario, etc. Additionally, it will leverage many advantages over the traditional method of using an excel spreadsheet by facitilating the collaboration between exercise designers belonging to multiple teams.

Additionally, Blueprint can be integrated with Player, Gallery, CITE and Steamfitter. Integrating Blueprint with these applications will automate the configuration process for an [exercise](#glossary).

In summary, Blueprint will allow users to view, edit, create, and approve events on the MSEL.

For installation, refer to these GitHub repositories.

- [Blueprint UI Repository](https://github.com/cmu-sei/Blueprint.Ui)
- [Blueprint API Repository](https://github.com/cmu-sei/Blueprint.Api)

### Blueprint Permissions

To use Blueprint, a user must be assigned Content Developer permissions and be added to their respective team.

There are three levels of permissions in Blueprint that affect the way a user interacts with the Blueprint application and collaborates on the MSEL creation. 

- [System Admin](#glossary): Can add users to a team, as well as assign the required permissions to users. Additionally, users with this permission can view, edit, create, and approve events on the MSEL.
- [Content Developer](#glossary): Can view, edit, create, and approve events on the MSEL.
- [Facilitator](#glossary): Manages the exercise, can advance moves, execute events, and check events as completed.

Most users will have the Content Developer permission, since that is all that is required to be able to create and collaborate with other teams on the MSEL creation. 

Refer to this section [Administrator Guide](#administrator-guide) for more information on additional administrative actions.

## User Guide

### MSEL Catalog

The MSEL Catalog shows created MSELs. Here, users are able to select the desired MSEL to work on, as well as create or delete them.

The following image will show some important hotspots about the MSEL Catalog. Reference the number on the hotspot to know more about this section.

![Blueprint Dashboard OE](../assets/img/blueprintDashboard-v2.png)

#### Add Blank MSEL
*Hotspot 1:*

One of the main features of Blueprint is the ability to be able to create a MSEL from scratch via the application. This feature is helpful for users since it will eliminate the hassle of using Excel spreadsheets and provide a more user-friendly application that will provide an easier visualization of the information.

#### Upload an Existing MSEL
*Hotspot 2:*

If creating a new MSEL from scratch is not desired, users can upload a pre-existing MSEL and continue editing it on the application by using this functionality. This is useful to share existing MSEL work without having to add the pieces of information to a blank MSEL one by one.

#### Filter Display

**Types**

*Hotspot 3:*

Users can use this filter to narrow down MSELs presented on the dashboard based on their categorization. Selections available are: All Types, Templates, and Not Templates.

**Statuses**

*Hotspot 4:*

Users can use this filter to narrow down MSELs presented on the dashboard based on their current status. Selections available are: All Statuses, Pending, Entered, Approved, and Completed.

**Search**

*Hotspot 5:*

This functionality will enable users to search for a specific MSEL, in case it is not presented at the top on the dashboard.

#### Manage MSEL
*Hotspot 6:*

**Download**

If users desire to have an offline copy of any desired MSEL, they will have the ability to download a copy to their devices by using the Download feature. If by any chance users donâ€™t have an internet connection, this feature will be useful since they will be able to work offline on the MSEL and then upload the MSEL back to the application, so that other users can see any changes made. Although users can work on the MSEL offline, it is not recommended since they will be missing on all of the helpful features that Blueprint offers.

**Upload**

With the Upload feature, users can update the information from the MSEL Card with the new uploaded information. This feature will modify all the existing information with the one found on the .xlsx file.

**Note:** When engaging in the export and import process of MSELs from the Blueprint application, it is imperative to ensure that events and settings of the MSEL align with your particular preferences. It is worth noting that on occasion, during the import process of MSELs into the application, it may be necessary to reconfigure settings and specific fields.

**Delete**

With the Delete feature, users will be able to delete existing MSEL Cards. By deleting the MSEL Card, all the information that was included in the MSEL will be deleted too.

**Copy**

With the Copy feature, users will be able to create a copy of an existing MSEL Card. With this feature, users will be able to modify the copy, instead of the original. This is useful if the user isn't sure of any new changes or to have a foothold of the information that is needed, instead of creating a new MSEL from scratch.

#### MSEL Cards
*Hotspot 7:*

Click on the desire MSEL card to access its information. Here, users can also edit or update the existing information. Changes made will be seen live by other users without the need of sharing a new document every time.

#### Template Feature
*Hotspot 8:*

Checkbox used to identify and/or assign which MSELs should be a template. 


### MSEL Definition

After uploading or creating a MSEL, users will be given the ability to edit any desired information, as well as add additional information to the MSEL. 

With this functionality, users can now edit the same MSEL, instead of each user having their own copy and then sending their edits to the individual responsible of recompiling all the edits. By allowing users to access the MSEL on-the-fly, this will ensure that everyone will have the same copy of the MSEL on the day of the live scenario.

#### Basic Information

On this tab, users will be able to edit and configure MSEL settings, as well as enable/disable integrations.
