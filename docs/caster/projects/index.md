# Caster Project

The top-level construct in Caster is called a *project*. The _project_ is a way to organize and categorize similar environments for multiple workspaces and directories within Caster. The main screen of Caster displays a list of the projects available and allows a user to create a new one.

A project is meant to:

- Categorize large events (like Gaining Cyber Dominance, Cybercom, CyberFlag or MCCORC)
- House directories, workspaces, and sub-directories

Users can add new projects, name projects, and save projects. A project's landing page in Caster has a navigation panel for easy movement within the project's files, workspaces, and directories. Projects can also be exported.
