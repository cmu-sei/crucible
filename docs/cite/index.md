# ![CITE Logo](../assets/img/cite-logo.png) **CITE:** Evaluating Threats

## Overview

### What is CITE?

[**CITE**](#glossary) is a web application created to integrate with the Crucible Framework and allows multiple participants from different organizations to evaluate, score, and comment on cyber incidents. CITE compares a user's score to their organization's score, group average scores, and the official exercise score. Scores are submitted for each [move](#glossary) as the exercise progresses and each of the historical scores can be recalled for reference at any time.

In the CITE User Interface, there are two major functional sections:

- [CITE Dashboard](#glossary): The dashboard shows exercise details like the date and time, incident summary, a suggested list of [actions](#glossary) for participants to consider taking, and suggested participant [roles](#glossary).
- [CITE Scoresheet](#glossary): The scoresheet compares participant scores to organization scores, group average scores, and the official score.

For installation, refer to these GitHub repositories.

- [CITE UI Repository](https://github.com/cmu-sei/CITE.Ui)

- [CITE API Repository](https://github.com/cmu-sei/CITE.Api)

### CITE Permissions
 
 In order to use CITE, a user must be assigned a scoring permission. 

 There are three levels of permissions in CITE that affect the way a team score is collaborated on and edited. 

 - [Basic](#glossary): Can only view the team score.
 - [Modify](#glossary): Can view and edit the team score.
 - [Submit](#glossary): Can view, edit, and submit the team score.

 Most users will have the modify-level permission; however, one or two users per team have submit-level permission, meaning that only one or two users per team can edit and/or submit on the team score.

 However, participants who can submit scores on behalf of their team can also add suggested actions and participant roles to the CITE Dashboard. 
 
 Refer to this section [Actions to Consider](#actions-to-consider) for more information.

## User Guide

### Moves

In CITE, a move is a defined period of time during an exercise, in which a series of events are distributed for users to discuss and assess the current incident severity.

When in Dashboard view, users will have two features to interact with moves:

- **Displayed Move:** Move that will be currently displayed on the screen. Here, users can see responses to previous moves and scores, but users will not be able to edit a response.

- **Current Move:** Move that is currently active. There are cases where the Displayed Move and the Current Move might be the same. Here, users are allowed to edit the category of the move.

### CITE Landing Page

The landing page of CITE provides a central approach to recopiling all evaluations that the user is a participant of into just one display.

![CITE Landing Page OE](../assets/img/CITELandingPage.png)

*Search for an Evaluation*

To search for an evaluation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to CITE's landing page.
2. Click on the Search Bar and add the name of the name of the evaluation.

### CITE Dashboard

The CITE Dashboard shows exercise details like the date and time, incident summary, a suggested list of actions for participants to consider taking, and suggested participant roles.

The following image will show some important hotspots about the CITE Dashboard. Reference the number on the hotspot to know more about each section.

![CITE Dashboard OE](../assets/img/CITE-Dashboard-v3.png)

#### Active Events & Moves
*Hotspot 1:* 

The name of the active event and the move number currently displayed.

If the Can Increment Move permission is assigned to the user, this section will add the button option "Advance Move", which will enable the user to advance CITE's current move, as well as go back and forth between moves using the arrows.

![CITE Advance Move OE](../assets/img/advanceMoveButton.png)

#### Situation Date & Time
*Hotspot 2:*

*Hotspot 3:*

Short description of the event. This section also allows for the use of HTML elements, useful when receiving MSEL information from Blueprint.

#### Actions to Consider
*Hotspot 4:*

Users can see the different actions necessary to be executed during the exercise. These actions are for everyone on the team and "per move", meaning they change at each move of the exercise.

These are added to guide users on an appropriate course of action during an exercise. However, these actions are not connected to the scoresheet.

#### Roles
*Hotspot 5:* 

The roles are added so that each team member will have a clear path of their responsibilities during the exercise. For this, roles can be customized for each team and then the team members decide what role each user should be assigned to.

Displays the various scores at the appropriate severity level for the disaplyed move. Here, scores are always visible.

#### Team Selection
*Hotspot 7:*

This feature enables a user who is part of a team, as well as an observer, to toggle back and forth between teams. When assigned an observer role, the user will be able to see how other teams progress during the exercise, as well as participate on their own team.

#### CITE Report Toggle
*Hotspot 8:*

This feature will redirect users to a printable version of the CITE report that recollects all user's responses throughout the exercise.
