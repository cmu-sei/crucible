# Players

To access the **Administration**, **Players** screen click **Admin** in the top navigation menu, then click **Players**. Most actions available in the Administration Players screen can also be performed in the Game Center under the **Players/Teams** tab. This screen serves as an alternative option.

The **Players** screen shows one *player* record for each time a *user* plays in a game. Remember, *players* are users who play in, or participate in, a game. A *user* is the real person in Gameboard.

Let's say you have a user named `Ned-Stark` in the Gameboard whose user id is `4b427a66`. If Ned has registered for three games in Gameboard, Ned appears on this screen three times: once for each of the three games. Ned will have a unique *player id* for each time he appears, but his *user id* is always `4b427a66`.

!!! note

    Ned can optionally choose a different player name (for example, `EddardS`) for each game before beginning play. Therefore, you will see entries on this screen with the same user id (`4b427a66`), but different player names (`Ned-Stark` and `EddardS`).

## Search

To search for a player across the whole of Gameboard enter a term into the **Search** field.

**names-pending:** filters by those participants whose display names are pending approval or disapproval.

**names-disallowed:** filters by those participants whose display names have been disapproved.

In the player search results, select the game link to go to that game's Game Center. Select `user id`, `player id`, `team id`, and `game id` to copy it to the clipboard.

## Player Session Status

- A yellow light indicates a player is registered to play but hasn't started a session.
- A green light indicates a player is active (i.e., has started a session).
