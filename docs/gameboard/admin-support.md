# Support Settings

## Greeting

In the **Greeting** field, enter a message. Your message appears as a banner on the Support page to welcome players. Customize it to fit your needs. The field supports the use of Markdown formatting.

## Ticket Auto-Labeling

This feature automatically assigns labels to tickets based on specific criteria, such as the play mode, game, challenge, or sponsor associated with the player who generated the ticket. Using the ticket auto-labeling option does categorize incoming tickets automatically by specific factors, which helps to streamline the ticket management process and making it easier to track and manage them.
