# About the Gameboard

Developed by Carnegie Mellon University's [Software Engineering Institute](github.com/cmu-sei) (SEI), Gameboard is a flexible web platform that provides game design capabilities and a competition-ready user interface. The *Gameboard * explains how to implement it when you want to run your own cybersecurity game.

## Gameboard concepts

*User* vs. *player* vs. *competitor*: A user is the real person who has an account on Gameboard (this requires a person to log into the Gameboard application using their Identity account). Players, participants, and competitors are users who are enrolled in a game. "Competitor" is not a term that appears in the Gameboard UI.

*Enrolled*: As a user who will play, compete, or otherwise participate in a game within the competition you must "join" or *enroll* in a game.  When a user *enrolls* in a game, they become a *player* of that game. 

*Participated* vs. *played*:  These terms are interchangeable -- a user who has enrolled in a game and launched a challenge has participated or played.

*Sponsor*: Describes the organization a player is associated with. In a government-sponsored competition like the President's Cup, a sponsor may be a department (e.g., Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense). In a school-sponsored competition, you may choose to have different universities represented as sponsors (e.g., Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh).
