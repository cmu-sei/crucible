# Giving Feedback as a Player

Provided that a Gameboard administrator has enabled and configured the *feedback* feature, players are permitted **one** feedback submission per game and/or per challenge. Every member of a team is permitted to provide individual feedback. The feedback form is available at any time after a session has started. This way, if participants quit the game before time expires they still have the opportunity to submit feedback.

The screen print below shows an example of a **challenge** feedback form as a player would see it.

Completing a challenge is not a requirement for submitting challenge feedback. Participants are able to begin a challenge, go through it, not make any submissions and still provide feedback. Perhaps the challenge was either too difficult for them or they just went down the wrong path. Either way, collecting their feedback is valuable.

Unsubmitted feedback and submitted feedback can be viewed in the reports. Once feedback has been submitted, a participant cannot go back and edit their feedback.

This documentation assumes the player is logged into a game and successfully enrolled. To view the *game* feedback as a participant:

1. From the game lobby, select **Start Session**, then click through the confirmations to start the session.
2. Scroll down to the Feedback form and complete the survey.
3. Click **Submit**, then **Confirm** when finished. Responses can't be edited after clicking **Submit**. Game feedback responses do auto-save.
