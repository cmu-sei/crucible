# The Profile screen

Participants access their *Profile* by browsing to the gameboard's designated URL and logging in. By default, authenticated participants land in the Profile screen if they haven't registered for a game yet. Otherwise, click **Profile** in the top navigation.

## Profile tab

### Display name

Set a default name for public display that is suitable for all audiences. This name will apply to all new games; however, you can customize it during registration.

### Sponsoring organization

Select *your* organization. Gameboard admins define who the sponsors are, and what image to associate with each.

## Certificates tab

View and print a certificate as proof of participation in a game. This feature allows players to provide a record of achievements to friends, colleagues, and organizations to validate professional development time. 

Select **Competitive** to find and print certificates which validate player performance in a *game*. Competitive certificates become available when the gameâ€™s execution period ends.

Select **Practice** to find and print certificates which validate player performance in a *practice challenge*. You can also save them as PDFs. Practice certificates are available immediately upon full completion of a practice challenge.

**Publish/Unpublish:** Optionally, players can *publish* a certificate on a per-certificate basis. Publishing a certificate means it will become public. Players can send the certificate link (click **Copy**) to anyone including non-Gameboard users. Players can *unpublish* a certificate at any time removing access to the certificate. Unpublishing a certificate means it will become private once again.

**Open:** Launches the certificate in a new tab in the browser. Here players can print their certificate and change the username on the certificate.

### Printing the certificate

There are several ways to print the certificate. Players can:

1. Click the **Print This Certificate** button. In the **Print** window, click **Print** to send the certificate to a printer or select **Save as PDF** to download the certificate in PDF format.
2. Press **Ctrl+P** or use the browser's **Print** function. In the **Print** window, click **Print** to send the certificate to a printer or select **Save as PDF** to download the certificate in PDF format.

!!! info

    Players can always save their certificate as an image file. In the certificate screen, right-click the certificate and select **Save image as...**, change the file type to `.png`, and click **Save**.

### Providing a different name

To regenerate your certificate with a different name (e.g., your real name instead of your Gameboard display name):

1. Click the **Provide Another Name** button.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the name you want to appear on your certificate.
3. Click **OK**.

The new name entered on the certificate is temporary and *only for printing purposes*. If you close and reopen the certificate, the new name reverts to the original Gameboard display name. If the certificate is published, viewers will see your Gameboard display name, not the temporary name.

### Creating certificate templates

Game organizers with the appropriate role/permissions create completion certificate templates in the game Metadata settings. See [Configuring certificate templates](completion-certificates.md) in the *Administering games* section of the Gameboard docs.

## History tab

View game history, including where you finished on the scoreboard and whether it was in practice or competition.
