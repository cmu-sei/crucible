# The Profile Screen

Participants access their _Profile_ by browsing to the Gameboard's designated URL and logging in. By default, authenticated participants land in the Profile screen if they haven't registered for a game yet. Otherwise, click **Profile** in the top navigation.

## Profile Tab

### Display Name

Set a default name for public display that is suitable for all audiences. This name will apply to all new games; however, you can customize it during registration.

### Sponsoring Organization

Select _your_ organization. Gameboard admins define who the sponsors are, and what image to associate with each.

## Certificates Tab

View and print a certificate as proof of participation in a game. This feature allows players to provide a record of achievements to friends, colleagues, and organizations to validate professional development time.

Select **Competitive** to find and print certificates which validate player performance in a _game_. Competitive certificates become available when the game's execution period ends.

Select **Practice** to find and print certificates which validate player performance in a _practice challenge_. You can also save them as PDFs. Practice certificates are available immediately upon full completion of a practice challenge.

**Publish/Unpublish:** Optionally, players can _publish_ a certificate on a per-certificate basis. Publishing a certificate means it will become public. Players can send the certificate link (click **Copy**) to anyone including non-Gameboard users. Players can _unpublish_ a certificate at any time removing access to the certificate. Unpublishing a certificate means it will become private once again.

**Open:** Launches the certificate in a new tab in the browser. Here players can print their certificate and change the username on the certificate.

### Printing the Certificate

There are several ways to print the certificate. Players can:

1. Click the **Print This Certificate** button. In the **Print** window, click **Print** to send the certificate to a printer or select **Save as PDF** to download the certificate in PDF format.
2. Press **Ctrl+P** or use the browser's **Print** function. In the **Print** window, click **Print** to send the certificate to a printer or select **Save as PDF** to download the certificate in PDF format.

!!! info

    Players can always save their certificate as an image file. In the certificate screen, right-click the certificate and select **Save image as...**, change the file type to `.png`, and click **Save**.

### Providing a Different Name

To regenerate your certificate with a different name (e.g., your real name instead of your Gameboard display name):

1. Click the **Provide Another Name** button.
2. In the **Name** field, enter the name you want to appear on your certificate.
3. Click **OK**.

The new name entered on the certificate is temporary and _only for printing purposes_. If you close and reopen the certificate, the new name reverts to the original Gameboard display name. If the certificate is published, viewers will see your Gameboard display name, not the temporary name.

### Creating Certificate Templates

Game organizers with the appropriate role/permissions create completion certificate templates in the game Metadata settings. See [Configuring certificate templates](admin-completion-certificates.md) in the _Administering games_ section of the Gameboard docs.

## History Tab

View game history, including where you finished on the scoreboard and whether it was in practice or competition.

## Settings Tab

Users granted a role with the appropriate permissions can view the **Settings tab**. Here, they may opt to receive browser notifications when support tickets are opened, closed, and updated. Users can choose to play an audio alert when a browser notification is received.

!!! note

    Browser notifications are subject to OS-level settings which may need to be changed and browser site settings for pop-ups and redirects which need to be allowed.
