# Using the Integrated Support feature

The gameboard platform comes with a built-in customer support interface so that competition hosts and administrators can assist competitors and players. This way, Gameboard is a "one-stop shop" and no outside apps or systems are required to track and measure issues reported by participants.

You must have either the `Support` role or `Admin` role to use the support feature and manage tickets. Assuming you have been granted the appropriate role in Gameboard, select **Support**.

## Support from participant point-of-view

### Creating new support ticket

You can create tickets from two places: the *Support* page or a challenge screen. In both cases you click the blue **Create Ticket** button to get started. If you are coming from the challenge screen, then the Support Code, player id, and challenge id are automatically generated; if you are not, then this information can be added later.  

In the **Summary**, enter a brief statement of the problem.

In the **Description**, enter a more detailed statement of your problem. Include error messages and other pertinent details.

Under **Attachments**, attach files--especially screen shots--here.

Click **Submit**.

After submitting the ticket, you can always **add a comment** and attach another file. Updates to a ticket are tracked under Activity. View a status change or an assignment change here. 

### Finding an existing ticket

From the Support page, use the dropdowns and the **Search** field to locate existing tickets. Filter tickets by status:

- Any Status
- Open
- In progress
- Not Closed (*Open* plus *In Progress*)
- Closed  

Filter by *Assigned to me*, *Unassigned*, and *Any Assignment*. Finally, you can also *filter by labels*.

Search by entering terms. Search covers ticket description, label, user, challenge title, and player.

### Creating new support ticket

The procedure for support staff (i.e., users given the `Support` role) to create a tickets is very similar to procedure for participants to create a ticket (see above). However, after a ticket has been created users with the `Support` role have more options to manage the tickets.  

### Managing support tickets

From the Ticket management side-bar:

**Assigned to:** Assign the ticket to another support person. The dropdown is filtered by users who have been granted the support role. 
	
**Status:** Move the ticket through the support workflow. Tickets are `Open`, `In progress`, or `Closed`.

- **Open** - Indicates that ticket has been reported, but not yet acted upon by support staff. The ticket is "waiting" on an action.
- **In progress** - The ticket is actively being worked on.
- **Closed** - The ticket has been resolved and no longer requires action from support or participants.

**Labels:** Labels are tags or keywords used to categorize the ticket. A label is like a hashtag (#) used on Twitter, Facebook, and other social apps. Labels help when searching for an issue; labels also help when reporting on metrics from your competition.

**Challenge:** When a ticket is associated with a challenge--meaning that the ticket was created from within the specific challenge--the challenge support code is shown here. If the challenge field is blank, you can view the challenge(s) the player is a part of in the Challenge dropdown. Attach the correct challenge from here.

**Player:** When a ticket is associated with a challenge it is also linked to a team or player. If the challenge is a team challenge, then all of the members of the team can view the ticket.

Add a **comment** to communicate with the participant.

### Copy to markdown

The **Copy to markdown** icon allows you to copy support ticket content to Markdown. You can paste it anywhere, including into a messaging app or email, with nicely formatted text, avoiding the need for links or logins to the Gameboard.

## Support-related Reporting

Support-related reporting provides you with a way to manage workloads and track trends during your competition. In the main menu, select **Reports**. Then click **Support** in the Reports screen.
