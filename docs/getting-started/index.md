# Getting Started with Crucible

Welcome to the Crucible Framework documentation! Crucible is a modular, open-source application framework designed for creating, deploying, and managing virtual environments to support cybersecurity training, education, and exercises.

## What is Crucible?

Crucible provides a comprehensive platform for cybersecurity professionals, educators, and students to engage in hands-on learning and training through realistic virtual environments. The framework consists of multiple integrated applications that work together to deliver complete cyber range experiences.

## Quick Start for Specific Roles

We provide detailed guides for the following roles within the Crucible ecosystem:

- **[Infrastructure Administrator](../roles/administrator/)**: Infrastructure administrators keep Crucible platforms healthy, secure, and scalable. They provision environments, manage access, and monitor day-to-day operations.

- **[Range Builder](../roles/range-builder/)**: Range Builders design and deliver complete cyber ranges. They combine infrastructure, scenarios, and learner-facing content into cohesive exercises.

- **[Instructor](../roles/instructor/)**: Instructors lead and execute Crucible exercises and training sessions. They guide participants, evaluate performance, and ensure learning objectives are met.

- **[Participant](../roles/participant/)**: Participants engage in Crucible exercises to develop and demonstrate cyber defense skills. They interact with simulated environments and apply techniques in realistic scenarios.
