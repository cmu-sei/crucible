# Getting Started with Crucible

**Welcome to the Crucible Framework documentation!** Crucible is a modular, open-source application framework designed for creating, deploying, and managing virtual environments to support cybersecurity training, education, and exercises. The framework consists of multiple integrated applications that work together to deliver complete cyber range experiences.

## Role-based Guides

We provide detailed guides for the following roles within the Crucible ecosystem.

- **[Infrastructure Administrator](../roles/administrator/)**: Infrastructure administrators keep Crucible platforms healthy, secure, and scalable. They provision environments, manage access, and monitor day-to-day operations.
- **[Range Builder](../roles/range-builder/)**: Range Builders design and deliver complete cyber ranges. They combine infrastructure, scenarios, and learner-facing content into cohesive exercises.
- **[Instructor](../roles/instructor/)**: Instructors lead and execute Crucible exercises and training sessions. They guide participants, evaluate performance, and ensure learning objectives are met.
- **[Participant](../roles/participant/)**: Participants engage in Crucible exercises to develop and demonstrate cyber defense skills. They interact with simulated environments and apply techniques in realistic scenarios.
