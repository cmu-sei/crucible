# Third-Party Applications

The Crucible Framework provides users with the necessary tools and resources for integrating open-source third-party applications with the platform's features and data. By leveraging open-source resources, users can save time and resources, and benefit from the expertise of the open-source community.

Administrators can customize the Crucible platform by adding applications that integrate with the features needed for specific exercises. This flexibility allows them to tailor the platform to their organization's needs and use tools built for their training goals. As a result, the platform stays useful and relevant as user needs change over time.
