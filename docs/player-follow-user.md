# Following a Participant 

The **user follow** feature in Player allows you to virtually look over a participant’s shoulder during a scenario. This is a useful feature when helping someone troubleshoot and for team members who are geographically separated. This can also be used by observers when evaluating or watching teams perform during an event.

To follow another participant:

1. In Player, in the left sidebar, select the **Virtual Machines** application.
2. In the main Player window, select **User List**.
>If you are a View Administrator (_ViewAdmin_), then you will see *all* the teams and *all* the participants. Otherwise, you will just see the team you are on and your teammates. 
3. Locate the participant in the scenario.
   - Use the **Search** feature to search on a participant's username if you know it.
   - Click **Expand All** to expand the teams to see all of the participants.
   - Click **Collapse All** to collapse the teams.
   - Select a team to expand it and see its participants.
   - Check **Hide Inactive** to display _only_ those participants who are working in a virtual machine at the moment.
4. Click the participant’s name. Now, you can see the console display for the virtual machine that the person is on in the main Player window. 
5. Click the icon next to the participant's name to follow that participant in a new browser tab. 

If the person switches virtual machines then your display automatically follows them. You can’t interact with them while following; and, if their virtual machine goes out of focus then following stops. 

Clicking the **Gear** icon in the upper left of the display you are following gives you the options to **Open In New Tab** and **Reconnect**. If you are already in a new browser tab, then you will see the **Fullscreen** option.
