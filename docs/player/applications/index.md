# Player Applications

Every Exercise in Player contains *applications*.  Applications are served elsewhere and viewed in a content panel in the Player user interface.  If the application requires authentication, we recommended you configure it to use the same identity server used by Player for the best user experience. The following are applications used in Player:

- Virtual Machines (VM-UI and VM-Console)
- Help desk using osTicket
- Messaging with Mattermost
- General Document Links (PDF, PNG, etc.)

## Working with Applications

All system allows Applications to be opened within a tab on the same screen or popped out into a new browser tab using the arrow.

## Virtual Machines (VM-UI and VM-Console)

The **VM List** is set up to provide links to any virtual machines that the user has permission to view. The tabular system allows the VM to be opened similar to an Application, within a tab on the same screen or popped out into a new browser tab using the icon. Users can also run commands on one or more virtual machines by dragging a box and shift clicking.

### Player VM Console application

- Load VMware consoles
- [Power On/Off VMs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/player-power-a-vm-on-or-off)
- [Copy/Paste](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/player-copy-and-paste-text)
- [Send files/Mount ISOs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/player-how-to-upload-files)

## Help desk using osTicket 

**osTicket** (https://osticket.com/), a widely-used open source support ticket system, can be configured and deployed for an exercise. Using this "built-in" help desk, participants can submit help requests to event administrators.

## Messaging with Mattermost 

**Mattermost** (https://mattermost.com/), an open source messaging platform can be configured and deployed to provide an "off the shelf" chat system for users. 

## General document links

Any documents or files  - PDF, PNG, etc. - that can be served on the web can be easily set up as an application for viewing.  This is particularly helpful for displaying instructions, intel, maps, and other information.
