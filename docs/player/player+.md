### Player Applications

Every Exercise in Player contains *applications*.  Applications are served elsewhere and viewed in a content panel in the Player user interface.  If the application requires authentication, we recommended you configure it to use the same identity server used by Player for the best user experience. The following are applications used in Player:

- Virtual Machines (VM-UI and VM-Console)
- Help desk using osTicket
- Messaging with Mattermost
- General Document Links (PDF, PNG, etc.)

**Working with Applications**

All system allows Applications to be opened within a tab on the same screen or popped out into a new browser tab using the arrow.

### Player Views

The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation is called the _view_. Depending upon your role (*end-user* view  versus *administrator* view) a view will look different.

##### Collapsible navigation panel

The left application navigation panel can be collapsed to provide additional display space. This side-bar is configurable per team by an administrator.

##### Focused app panel

The focused app panel displays the selected app.

##### Menu select

Log off here. If you are a view administrator, you have the option to edit the view from here. The option to enable Dark Theme is here too.

Think of *application templates* as "helpers" for adding new or common applications to Player. For example, the Virtual Machines application template contains several URLs. Including them in a template means that these values may be used over and over as part of a template--rather than manually entering the same information over and over again with each new view. 

In the Player system, creating a new application template is a relatively rare occurrence when compared to creating a view. Create the application templates first because you will use them on each view.0.
