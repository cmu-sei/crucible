# Player How to: Copy and paste text

The procedures below show you how to:

- Copy text from a local machine (that is, an _out-of-game_ computer) and paste it into a Player virtual machine, and
- Copy text from a Player virtual machine and paste it into a local machine

Procedures assume you are in the Player VM Console app. For help on Player applications, see the [Player Applications](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/player-applications) guide.

## From local to Player VM 

> Note: There is a 64K size limitation to the text block users can copy into and out of the player.

1. On your local machine, open a text file or Word file.
2. Select and copy the text you want to place into a Player virtual machine.
3. In the Player VM Console app, select the virtual machine you want.
4. Select where in the virtual machine you want the copied text to go (this can be a new file or an open application).
5. At the top of the Player window, click __Paste__. This inserts the copied text into the virtual machine.

## From Player VM to local

1. In the Player VM Console app, select the virtual machine you want.
2. On the virtual machine, select the text you would like to copy. Copy your text first to the virtual machine’s clipboard (how you do this depends upon the application you’re using).
3. Once you’ve copied your text to the virtual machine clipboard, click __Copy__ at the top of the Player window. You should then see a `Copied Virtual Machine Clipboard` confirmation message.
4. On your local machine, paste the copied text into a Notepad file or Word file.
