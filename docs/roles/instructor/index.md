# Instructor Guide

???+ warning "Caution"
    Crucible environments are often customized. Procedures, scoring, and user interfaces may vary by deployment. Review local documentation or range notes before facilitating exercises.

## Overview

Instructors lead and support learners as they navigate Crucible exercises. Your focus is on **guiding understanding**, **maintaining engagement**, and **creating meaningful learning experiences**. You don't have to master every technical detail—what matters is helping participants connect actions in the range to the real-world skills those actions represent.

## Before the Exercise

Use this stage to **understand what learners will encounter** and **set them up for success**.

### Preparation Focus Areas

- **Understand objectives**: Know what skills or decisions the exercise aims to build.
- **Preview the flow**: Familiarize yourself with scenario structure, milestones, and transitions.
- **Check access**: Verify that participants can reach their environments and accounts.
- **Align expectations**: Communicate timing, format, and support options.

### Recommended Practices

- Share a **clear, welcoming introduction** that frames the exercise as exploration.
- Anticipate common hurdles and decide what level of help you'll provide.
- Encourage learners to take responsibility for preparation (accounts, tools, readings).
- Coordinate with Range Builders or Admins if you anticipate technical issues.

## During the Exercise

Your presence shapes the learning environment. Effective instructors **observe, prompt, and guide** rather than over-explain.

### Facilitation Tips

- **Start with orientation**: Briefly remind participants of goals and flow.
- **Observe patterns**: Watch for hesitation, confusion, or disengagement.
- **Prompt reflection**: Ask questions like "What are you seeing?" or "What might that mean?"
- **Encourage peer learning**: Let learners explain solutions to one another.
- **Intervene minimally**: Support problem-solving without taking over.
- **Keep communication open**: Use chat or voice to check in periodically.

### Managing Momentum

- Keep track of time, but prioritize depth of learning over strict pacing.
- Encourage teams to narrate their reasoning so others can follow their approach.
- If the environment falters, turn downtime into teaching moments (incident response, contingency thinking).

## After the Exercise

Reflection is where insight turns into understanding. Your debrief sets the tone for how participants process what they learned.

### Debrief Focus Areas

- **Reconstruct the event**: Walk through key actions or turning points.
- **Highlight decisions**: Discuss why particular choices mattered.
- **Compare perspectives**: Encourage teams to share their different approaches.
- **Connect to real-world practices**: Translate scenario outcomes into professional takeaways.
- **Celebrate progress**: Recognize effort, creativity, and teamwork.

### Feedback and Assessment

???+ tip "Deep Dive into CERT Research"
    We documented our own experience with team-based assessments in :material-book: *[Self-Assessment in Training and Exercise](https://sei.cmu.edu/library/self-assessment-in-training-and-exercise/)*.

- Provide feedback that is **specific, encouraging, and forward-looking**.
- Emphasize growth over grading.
- Use formative observations—what participants *did and thought*—to inform next steps.
- Encourage participants to document what they learned or would do differently next time.

## Supporting Learners

Crucible exercises can be intense. Participants benefit from instructors who are **approachable, calm, and resourceful**.

### Common Support Situations

| Challenge              | Instructor Focus                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confusion about goals  | Reframe the task; remind them what success looks like.    |
| Technical problems     | Keep them moving—note the issue and escalate if needed.   |
| Frustration or fatigue | Pause for perspective; celebrate small wins.              |
| Off-topic exploration  | Redirect by asking how their path relates to the mission. |

### Encouraging Collaboration

- Reinforce communication and documentation habits early.
- Recognize teams that share knowledge effectively.
- Use competition sparingly—keep the emphasis on learning, not winning.

## Growing as an Instructor

Teaching in Crucible is a continual craft.
Reflect after each session and refine how you engage, question, and guide.

### Ongoing Development

- **Review participant feedback**: It reveals patterns in engagement and challenge.
- **Connect with other instructors**: Share stories and strategies.
- **Stay current**: Update your knowledge of evolving threats, tools, and frameworks.
- **Experiment**: Try new facilitation styles and debrief formats.

## Best Practices Summary

- Focus on **learning, not performance**
- Encourage **exploration over perfection**
- Foster **communication and teamwork**
- Reflect and **iterate each time**
