# Scenario Development

This section covers reasoning, designing, and implementing automated cyber scenarios using Steamfitter's orchestration capabilities.

Steamfitter enables you to create dynamic, responsive scenarios that adapt to participant actions and progress through predetermined timelines. As a Range Builder, your goal is to combine **automation, decision points,** and **branching logic** to create engaging, realistic training experiences.

## Scenario Design Principles

| Principle               | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gradual Difficulty**  | Begin with guided tasks, then layer complexity. Offer multiple approaches and stretch challenges for advanced users. |
| **Realistic Timelines** | Align scenario flow with real-world operations: detection → investigation → response → recovery.                     |
| **Adaptive Response**   | Use branching logic: success leads forward, failure redirects to remediation or alternate routes.                    |
| **Learning Resilience** | Build recovery mechanisms so participants can recover from common missteps and still complete the experience.        |

## Scenario Architecture

### Task Grouping

Organize activities into logical **phases**:

| Phase                    | Focus                    | Example Tasks                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Initial Detection** | Introduce the incident   | Automated alert, manual acknowledgment, initial assessment |
| **2. Investigation**     | Deepen analysis          | Evidence collection, threat classification, documentation  |
| **3. Response**          | Drive participant action | Containment, communication, remediation                    |
| **4. Recovery**          | Reinforce learning       | Restoration, lessons learned, final reporting              |

### Task Relationships

| Relationship Type | Description                         | Example                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Sequential**    | Tasks that must complete in order   | Run scan → analyze results                  |
| **Parallel**      | Tasks that can occur simultaneously | Collect logs and review alerts concurrently |
| **Conditional**   | Triggered by specific outcomes      | Continue only if "analysis complete"        |
| **Recovery**      | Activated when failure occurs       | Launch fallback evidence-collection task    |

| Example                | Description                        | Timing                      | Action                   | Expected Outcome       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Initial Compromise** | Simulate attacker scanning network | 5 minutes into scenario     | Network scan executes    | Scan completes         |

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario Design**       | Define learning objectives clearly; map each task to a skill; balance difficulty; include timing and recovery paths.                      |
| **Task Organization**     | Use descriptive names; group related tasks logically; handle errors gracefully; provide meaningful feedback; document logic.              |
| **Testing & Maintenance** | Test thoroughly before deployment; monitor live execution; collect feedback; revise scenarios after exercises; version control templates. |
