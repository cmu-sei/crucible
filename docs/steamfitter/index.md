# Steamfitter Overview

Steamfitter gives content developers the ability to create scenarios consisting of a series of scheduled tasks, manual tasks, and injects which run against virtual machines during an event. These scenarios enable the content developer to automate assessments and configurations.

In the Steamfitter UI, there are four major functional sections:

- [Scenario Templates:](./steamfitter-scenario-templates) Used to organize tasks into groups that that can be reused on demand.
- [Scenarios:](./steamfitter-scenarios) Displays all planned, running, and completed scenarios.
- [Tasks:](steamfitter-tasks) Used to create and execute ad-hoc tasks. 
- [History:](steamfitter-history) Displays the results of all tasks executed by the user.

### Steamfitter Permissions

In order to use Steamfitter, a user must be given **Content Developer** permissions by a Steamfitter System Admin. Any user who visits the Steamfitter URL is automatically added to the user list with no permissions. Only a Steamfitter System Admin can grant another user elevated permissions.

1. In Steamfitter, in the top-right corner, select your user name then **Administration**.
2. Check the **ContentDeveloper** box next to the name of the user. 
3. Select your user name then **Exit Administration**.

> Content Developer and System Administrator within Steamfitter only apply to the Steamfitter application - not to any other application in the Crucible framework.
