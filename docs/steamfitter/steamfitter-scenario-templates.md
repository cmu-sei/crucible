## Steamfitter Scenario Templates

Scenario templates are where predefined tasks are grouped; scenario templates are used to create scenarios that can be run on-demand. All that is required to enter a new scenario template is a **Name**, **Description**, and **Duration**.

After adding the new scenario template, you can **Create a Scenario**, **Copy** a scenario template to create a duplicate, **Edit** it, and **Delete** it.

Add tasks in the Scenario Templates screen by clicking the **+** ("plus") icon. Complete the same task information as you did when you created a new task. For additional help, see [Steamfitter Tasks](./steamfitter-tasks).
