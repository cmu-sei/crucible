# Admin features

TopoMojo has an admin interface called **Admin Dashboard**. To access the Admin Dashboard, you'll need the `admin` role. In the top-right corner, click the **Admin** button. The initial `admin` role is given to the first user who authenticates successfully.

### Hub Connections

**Hub connections** informs Topo admins about which users are currently logged into TopoMojo.

### Announcement

The **Announcement** feature allows Topo admins to broadcast important messages to everyone in TopoMojo. Announcements appear in the Topo interface. In the Message field, enter the content of the announcement and click **Send**.

### Import/Export

This is future functionality for the TopoMojo UI. The API equivalent of import/export is available for use.

### Janitor

The **Janitor** service cleans up unused resources (e.g., a workspace VM that has been idle for a long time) in TopoMojo.

**Cleanup Report:** Provides a log of the Janitor's activity.
