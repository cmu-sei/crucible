The **Play** page is where you can interact with your lab in the same way others will when they launch your content or "play" through your challenge. Play deploys a read-only copy of all virtual machines in the workspace; this gives the player their own deployed configurations.

**Variant:** Specify which variant of the challenge you wish to play (if it is a *variant* challenge).

**Max Attempts:** The maximum number of submission attempts allowed when answering questions.

**Max Minutes:** The maximum number of minutes permitted to play before the gamespace expires.
