# Tutorials

These tutorials walk you through building and delivering cybersecurity exercises and competitions using Crucible, TopoMojo, and Gameboard. Each tutorial stands on its own and focuses on a specific activity using the Crucible environment.

These tutorials do not provide reference documentation, list every option or configuration setting, or replace the [Core Application Guides](../landing/index.md). Instead, they focus on guided workflows that show how to use the applications together to achieve a specific outcome.

## Building an On-Demand Exercise (ODX)

This tutorial shows you how to create an on-demand exercise using a group of Crucible applications. You start from a clean, default Crucible stack and build a working on-demand exercise delivered through Moodle. You use Caster, Player, Steamfitter, and Alloy to define infrastructure, scenarios, and participant interaction. Finally, you connect the exercise to Moodle using the Crucible Plugin for Moodle.

## Creating a TopoMojo Challenge

This tutorial walks you through creating a cybersecurity challenge in TopoMojo, a virtual lab builder and player. You build a challenge inside a workspace that contains virtual machines, artifacts, and configuration. When users start the challenge, the system deploys a read-only gamespace for participants to interact with.
