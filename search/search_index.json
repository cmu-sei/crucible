A common example of an app in Player is the Mattermost messaging platform.</p> <p>App Template: The settings associated with an app added to a team's View. You can create an app template for common apps in a view with default settings that an administrator can override if needed.</p> <p>Authentication: Player uses IdentityServer 4 to authenticate users. Authentication gets a user into Player. However, to determine what a user can open and/or edit within Player, administrators need to set the required permissions within the Player Administration View under the Users Administrator tab.</p> <p>Focused Application Panel: The focused app panel displays the selected application in an iFrame. The iFrame points to the URL specified by the application template. The application within the focused app panel is responsible for authentication and content. Player displays content but has no control of the application running within the focused app panel.</p> <p>Notification: A message sent to a specific user, team, or view from an Administrator or an app with permission.</p> <p>Permission: A key/value pair that any application can create and use if the system grants it permission. Administrators can assign permissions to users or teams. Some permissions such as <code>Superadmin</code> are \"read-only\". The system designates <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>Superadmin</code> as permanent permissions, which no one can edit or delete.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged-in users associated with a view. Teams can view a particular set of applications and have team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: Upon their first login, Player automatically adds users identified in an identity server configured for the Player system. Pre-load users into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view. Edit, clone, and delete a view.</p> <p>Views: The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation. Depending upon your role (end-user vs administrator) a view will look different.</p>"},{"location":"roles/","title":"Role-Based Guides","text":"<p>We provide detailed guides for the following roles within the Crucible ecosystem:</p>"},{"location":"roles/#infrastructure-administrator","title":"Infrastructure Administrator","text":"<p>Infrastructure Administrators keep Crucible platforms healthy, secure, and scalable.

If your files aren't already in an ISO file format, TopoMojo wraps them in an ISO after upload.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For ISO uploads to work, TopoMojo needs an NFS (Network File System) datastore presented to vSphere and TopoMojo must be able to access it.</p> <p>The Files tab in TopoMojo is where you upload ISO files to attach to virtual machines. Supply the ISO you want to attach to your VM. The ISO adds extra resources that the original VM might not include. ISO files are disk images TopoMojo mounts as virtual CD drives on the VM. You want to attach an ISO when you need additional software, datasets, or other resources.</p> <p>Drag and Drop: Admins drag their ISO file into the box on Files tab or browse to locate it on their own device.</p> <p>By default, the Local filter only displays ISOs available in the current workspace.</p> <p>When you upload an ISO file, TopoMojo creates a folder with this GUID--called out in green in screen print 1 below--in the folder name in the NFS datastore. TopoMojo puts your ISO in that folder. Only the current workspace, that is, your workspace has access to the ISO file.</p> <p>Screen print 1: GUID and Local filter applied</p> <p></p> <p>When you remove the Local filter, you can see all of the ISOs in the global folder on the NFS data store. (The folder name will contain a GUID of all zeros.) These global ISOs are available to every workspace in TopoMojo.</p> <p>You can attach an ISO to a VM in the challenge workspace Templates tab. See \"Adding and editing templates\" in the Building a new Workspace chapter of this guide. When you select an ISO here, TopoMojo attaches the ISO to the VM upon its deployment.</p> <p>You can also attach an ISO to a VM using the workspace Challenge tab's Variant Detail function. This \"dynamic ISO attachment\" gives you the ability to attach a variant-specific ISO file to a template. You must specify a target(s) here. See also \"Variants\" in the Challenge tab chapter of this guide.</p>"},{"location":"topomojo/finding-a-space/","title":"Finding a Space","text":"<p>Once you're in TopoMojo, you can browse for existing TopoMojo workspaces and gamespaces.
