A common example of an app in Player is the Mattermost messaging platform.</p> <p>App Template: The settings associated with an app added to a team's View. You can create an app template for common apps in a view with default settings that an administrator can override if needed.</p> <p>Authentication: Player uses IdentityServer 4 to authenticate users. Authentication gets a user into Player. However, to determine what a user can open and/or edit within Player, administrators need to set the required permissions within the Player Administration View under the Users Administrator tab.</p> <p>Focused Application Panel: The focused app panel displays the selected application in an iFrame. The iFrame points to the URL specified by the application template. The application within the focused app panel is responsible for authentication and content. Player displays content but has no control of the application running within the focused app panel.</p> <p>Notification: A message sent to a specific user, team, or view from an Administrator or an app with permission.</p> <p>Permission: A key/value pair that any application can create and use if the system grants it permission. Administrators can assign permissions to users or teams. Some permissions such as <code>Superadmin</code> are \"read-only\". The system designates <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>Superadmin</code> as permanent permissions, which no one can edit or delete.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged-in users associated with a view. Teams can view a particular set of applications and have team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: Upon their first login, Player automatically adds users identified in an identity server configured for the Player system. Pre-load users into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view. Edit, clone, and delete a view.</p> <p>Views: The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation. Depending upon your role (end-user vs administrator) a view will look different.</p>"},{"location":"roles/","title":"Roles in the Crucible Ecosystem","text":"<p>When we discuss \"roles\" in Crucible, we're discussing two concepts:</p> <ol> <li>Organizational roles: That is, what a person does in their program (e.g., Infrastructure Administrator, Range Builder, Instructor, and Participant).</li> <li>Application roles: Permission bundles applied to users in each application (e.g., Administrator, Content Developer, Observer, View Admin, View Member).</li> </ol> <p>A Permission defines what action (or actions) a user can perform within a Crucible application.

Linked templates reduce backend storage use and provide a shared, consistent VM environment that users can become familiar with across challenges.</li> <li>Use a Challenge Server: Use a dedicated challenge server VM as the control point for the challenge. A challenge server can run startup scripts, host grading logic or websites, collect logs, and perform automation. This approach lets you maximize the use of linked templates by placing configuration, automation, and grading on a single unlinked VM. We provide a reference challenge server on GitHub: github.com/cmu-sei/Challenge-Server.</li> <li>Template Visibility: Set templates as visible or hidden. Visible templates expose a UI console to users. Hidden templates do not expose a UI console but may remain accessible over the network. Hide templates that users should not access directly, such as attacker or backend systems.</li> <li>Template Naming: Use clean, descriptive names for templates. Avoid tags, IDs, or internal details in visible template names. Use unique or structured names for hidden templates to help administrators identify resources during troubleshooting.</li> <li>Template Count: Add VM templates only when required. Fewer templates reduce infrastructure usage and keep challenges easier to understand and maintain.</li> <li>Clean Before Saving: Clean templates before saving them.
