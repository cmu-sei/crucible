A common example of an app in Player is the Mattermost messaging platform.</p> <p>App Template: The settings associated with an app added to a team's View. You can create an app template for common apps in a view with default settings that an administrator can override if needed.</p> <p>Authentication: Player uses IdentityServer 4 to authenticate users. Authentication gets a user into Player. However, to determine what a user can open and/or edit within Player, administrators need to set the required permissions within the Player Administration View under the Users Administrator tab.</p> <p>Focused Application Panel: The focused app panel displays the selected application in an iFrame. The iFrame points to the URL specified by the application template. The application within the focused app panel is responsible for authentication and content. Player displays content but has no control of the application running within the focused app panel.</p> <p>Notification: A message sent to a specific user, team, or view from an Administrator or an app with permission.</p> <p>Permission: A key/value pair that any application can create and use if the system grants it permission. Administrators can assign permissions to users or teams. Some permissions such as <code>Superadmin</code> are \"read-only\". The system designates <code>ExerciseAdmin</code> and <code>Superadmin</code> as permanent permissions, which no one can edit or delete.</p> <p>Role: A set of permissions grouped together and assigned to a user or team.</p> <p>Team: A group of logged-in users associated with a view. Teams can view a particular set of applications and have team-level roles/permissions.</p> <p>User: Upon their first login, Player automatically adds users identified in an identity server configured for the Player system. Pre-load users into Player using the Player API.</p> <p>View: These are the settings associated with building a view. Edit, clone, and delete a view.</p> <p>Views: The collection of content a participant can interact with during a cyber simulation. Depending upon your role (end-user vs administrator) a view will look different.</p>"},{"location":"roles/","title":"Role-Based Guides","text":"<p>We provide detailed guides for the following roles within the Crucible ecosystem:</p>"},{"location":"roles/#infrastructure-administrator","title":"Infrastructure Administrator","text":"<p>Infrastructure Administrators keep Crucible platforms healthy, secure, and scalable.

If set to <code>1</code>, then the two users could encroach on each other's work on the single VM.</p> <p>When deciding how many replicas you need, keep resources in mind. If, as in our example above, we only need two copies of the VM at any given time don't set Replicas to <code>5</code>. TopoMojo will deploy five, two will get used, and the other three won't get used.</p> <p><code>-1</code>: Setting Replicas to <code>-1</code> means TopoMojo will deploy one VM template copy per user. If there are two users, then TopoMojo deploys two copies; if there are 10 users, then 10 copies. TopoMojo does not deploy extra VMs. Use this setting in conjunction with the Gameboard app, where Gameboard informs TopoMojo on how many copies to make based upon the Gameboard team size.</p> <p>The value set in Replicas only applies to the template you are editing; not every template in the workspace. So, if you want the same number of copies deployed in a gamespace for each template, you'll have to edit each template individually.</p>"},{"location":"topomojo/#machines-tab","title":"Machines Tab","text":"<p>This tab lists all VMs TopoMojo is tracking and the gamespaces they belong to, without using the vSphere Client.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><code>gamespace</code> tells you this is a gamespace VM.</li> <li><code>pc5-ubuntu-server-2204-594</code> is the name of the VM.</li> <li><code>#d9b090c92728424781537c66b3ee2f4b</code> after the hash tag is the gamespace GUID.</li> </ul> <p>The Machines tab is helpful when you want to find all the VMs related to a gamespace (e.g., <code>PC6 Stock Topology v1</code> in the screen print above).
